# Wine-Quality-Analysis-Major-Project
Wine 
industry shows a recent growth spurt as social drinking is on the rise. The price of wine depends on a rather abstract concept of wine appreciation 
by wine tasters, opinion among whom may have a high degree of variability. Pricing of wine depends on such a volatile factor to some 
extent. Another key factor in wine certification and quality assessment is physicochemical tests which are laboratory-based and takes into account 
factors like acidity, pH level, the presence of sugar and other chemical properties. For the wine market, it would be of interest if human quality of 
tasting can be related to the chemical properties of wine so that certification and quality assessment and assurance process is more controlled.
